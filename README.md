# React App Setup and Deployment Guide

Welcome to the React application setup and deployment guide. This document will help you get the application running on your local machine and deploy it to Heroku.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd [repository-name]
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application on your local machine:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Deploying to Heroku

1. Create a Heroku account if you do not have one.
2. Install the Heroku CLI on your machine.
3. Log in to your Heroku account through the CLI:
   ```
   heroku login
   ```
4. Create a new Heroku app:
   ```
   heroku create [app-name]
   ```
5. Add a remote to your local repository for Heroku:
   ```
   heroku git:remote -a [app-name]
   ```
6. Deploy your app to Heroku:
   ```
   git push heroku master
   ```
7. Open the app in your browser:
   ```
   heroku open
   ```

## Important Files and Commands

- `public/index.html`: The entry point of your React application.
- `src/App.js`: The main React component that holds your app logic.
- `src/index.js`: The JavaScript entry point that renders the React app using ReactDOM.
- `src/components/Component1.js` and `src/components/Component2.js`: React components used in your app.
- `package.json`: Lists the dependencies and scripts for the app.
- `.env`: Stores your environment variables.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files that should not be committed to Git.
- `build/`: Contains the production build of your app.
- `Procfile`: Used by Heroku to run your app.
